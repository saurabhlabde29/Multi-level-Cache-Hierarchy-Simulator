# Multi-level-Cache-Hierarchy-Simulator

Language: C++

• Modeled a trace-driven, highly parameterized two-level cache hierarchy simulator with support for L1 victim cache. 

• Implemented LRU (Least Recently Used) & LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache replacement policies along with write through - not allocate and write back - allocate write policies.

• Different Memory Hierarchy configurations were compared in terms of miss rate and Average Access Time (AAT) based on the results obtained from running the SPEC95 benchmark suites.
